# Below is a breakdown of the iOS SDK by native frameworks:

1. **UIKit Framework**:
   - UIKit is the primary framework for building user interfaces in iOS apps.
   - It includes classes for views, view controllers, and other UI elements like buttons, labels, text fields, and table views.
   - UIKit provides support for event handling, touch interactions, animations, and gestures.
   - Key classes: UIViewController, UIView, UITableView, UICollectionView, UIButton, UILabel, UITextField, UINavigationController.

2. **Foundation Framework**:
   - Foundation is a core framework providing fundamental classes for data storage, networking, and concurrency.
   - It includes classes for data types, collections (arrays, dictionaries, sets), file management, and networking (URLSession).
   - Foundation also provides support for date and time, notifications, and key-value coding.
   - Key classes: NSObject, NSString, NSArray, NSDictionary, URLSession, DateFormatter, NotificationCenter.

3. **Core Data Framework**:
   - Core Data is a framework for managing the model layer objects in an iOS app.
   - It provides an object graph management and persistence framework, allowing developers to define data models and interact with a SQLite database.
   - Core Data supports data querying, sorting, fetching, and relationships between objects.
   - Key classes: NSManagedObject, NSManagedObjectContext, NSPersistentStoreCoordinator, NSFetchRequest.

4. **Core Animation Framework**:
   - Core Animation is a framework for creating and managing animations in iOS apps.
   - It provides high-performance, hardware-accelerated animation capabilities for animating views, layers, and transitions.
   - Core Animation supports basic animations, keyframe animations, and complex animations with timing functions and layer-based transformations.
   - Key classes: CALayer, CABasicAnimation, CAKeyframeAnimation, CATransition.

5. **Core Graphics Framework**:
   - Core Graphics (Quartz 2D) is a framework for drawing 2D graphics and performing vector-based rendering.
   - It provides APIs for creating custom drawings, paths, shapes, gradients, and patterns.
   - Core Graphics supports advanced features like alpha blending, anti-aliasing, and color management.
   - Key classes: CGContext, CGPath, CGColor, CGGradient, CGImage.

6. **MapKit Framework**:
   - MapKit is a framework for embedding maps and location-based services into iOS apps.
   - It provides classes for displaying map views, annotations, overlays, and user location tracking.
   - MapKit supports features like geocoding, reverse geocoding, routing, and searching for points of interest.
   - Key classes: MKMapView, MKAnnotation, MKOverlay, MKDirections, MKLocalSearch.

7. **AVFoundation Framework**:
   - AVFoundation is a framework for working with audiovisual media in iOS apps.
   - It provides classes for capturing, playing, editing, and exporting audio and video content.
   - AVFoundation supports features like multimedia playback, recording, editing, and media metadata manipulation.
   - Key classes: AVPlayer, AVAudioPlayer, AVCaptureSession, AVAsset, AVComposition.

8. **Core Location Framework**:
   - Core Location is a framework for accessing the device's location and heading information.
   - It provides classes for obtaining the device's current location, monitoring location changes, and performing geocoding and reverse geocoding.
   - Core Location also supports region monitoring and significant location change monitoring.
   - Key classes: CLLocationManager, CLLocation, CLGeocoder, CLRegion.

9. **UIKit Dynamics Framework**:
   - UIKit Dynamics is a framework for adding physics-based animations and behaviors to UIKit elements.
   - It provides classes for defining dynamic behaviors like gravity, collision, attachment, and push.
   - UIKit Dynamics allows developers to create interactive and realistic animations based on physics principles.
   - Key classes: UIDynamicAnimator, UIDynamicBehavior, UIGravityBehavior, UICollisionBehavior.

10. **EventKit Framework**:
    - EventKit is a framework for accessing and managing calendar and reminder events on iOS devices.
    - It provides classes for accessing the device's calendar database, creating, modifying, and deleting calendar events and reminders.
    - EventKit supports features like event querying, event recurrence, and calendar subscriptions.
    - Key classes: EKEventStore, EKEvent, EKCalendar, EKReminder.

These native frameworks are essential building blocks for iOS app development, providing developers with a wide range of functionalities to create feature-rich and engaging applications.
