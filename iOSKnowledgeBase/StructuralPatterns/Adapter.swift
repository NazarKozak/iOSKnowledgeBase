/// The Adapter acts as a wrapper between two objects. It catches calls for one object and transforms them to format and interface recognizable by the second object.
/// Usage examples: The Adapter pattern is pretty common in Swift code. Itâ€™s very often used in systems based on some legacy code. In such cases, 
/// Adapters make legacy code work with modern classes.
/// Identification: Adapter is recognizable by a constructor which takes an instance of a different abstract/interface type.
/// When adapter receives a call to any of its methods, it translates parameters to appropriate format and then directs the call to one or several methods of the wrapped object.

/// The Target defines the domain-specific interface used by the client code.

    func request() -> String {
        "Target: The default target's behavior."
    }
}

/// The Adaptee contains some useful behavior, but its interface is incompatible
/// with the existing client code. The Adaptee needs some adaptation before the
/// client code can use it.

    func specificRequest() -> String {

/// interface.
